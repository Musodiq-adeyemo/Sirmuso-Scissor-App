# FILE CREATION
This section contains all the files needed for the creation of this project which is:

## main.py
This file is the engine of the project which is used for running the project. 
It is used to run all API endpoints using FastAPI.
This file contains a declared app that is used to connect all routers to the API Endpoint. This also contained the display endpoints which are used to connect the API Endpoint with jinja2 template that is used to display some information.

# AUTHENTICATION AND AUTHORIZATION
This website authentication is solely based on Oauth2.
OAuth2 is a specification that defines several ways to handle authentication and authorization.
It is quite an extensive specification and covers several complex use cases.
It includes ways to authenticate using a "third party".
An OAUTH2PasswordBearer can be imported from fastapi security module.
This also has a built-in form known as the OUATH2PasswordRequestForm which is  an authorized form for user authorization.
Jwt and jwtError are imported from the python- Jose which is used to encode and decode tokens, data, secret keys, algorithms, and so on.

# JINJA2 Template
Jinja2 is a modern-day templating language for Python developers. It was made after Djangoâ€™s template. It is used to create HTML, XML, or other markup formats that are returned to the user via an HTTP request.

## Using Jinja2Templates
#### Import Jinja2Templates.
#### Create a templates object that you can re-use later.
#### Declare a Request parameter in the path operation that will return a template.
#### Use the templates you created to render and return a TemplateResponse, passing the request as one of the key-value pairs in the Jinja2 "context".

The folders under jinja2 template are: 
### Static folder
### Templates folder

## Static Folder
### Main.css
The main.css file is the file that contains all the CSS styling for the website frontend side.

## Template Folder
### Base.html

### Home.html

### analysis.html
### custom_page.html

### custom.html

### dashboard.html
### profile_page.html

### qrcode.html
### settings.html

### signin.html

### signup.html
### upload_profile.html
### url_info.html

### welcome.html

The jinja2 template is the backbone of the client side in this project and used to displayed all information on the website.
